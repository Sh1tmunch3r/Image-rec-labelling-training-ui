# CUDA Detection Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds comprehensive CUDA detection, diagnostics, and troubleshooting capabilities to the Image Labeling Studio Pro application, addressing the issue of GPU detection on Windows systems with NVIDIA GPUs.

## Problem Solved

Users with CUDA-capable systems (e.g., Windows with GTX 1650, CUDA 13.0, Driver 581.57) were experiencing issues where PyTorch wasn't properly detecting or utilizing their GPU. The application lacked:
1. Diagnostic tools to identify the issue
2. Clear error messages and warnings
3. Troubleshooting guidance
4. User-friendly device selection

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive CUDA Diagnostics (device_utils.py)

**New Functions:**
- `get_cuda_diagnostics()`: Collects all CUDA-related information
- `log_cuda_diagnostics()`: Logs diagnostics with context-sensitive troubleshooting

**Information Collected:**
- PyTorch version
- CUDA version (or None if CPU-only PyTorch)
- CUDA availability status
- Device count
- Device name(s)
- CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable
- Python executable path

**Troubleshooting Logic:**
- Detects CPU-only PyTorch → Suggests reinstallation with CUDA
- Detects CUDA present but unavailable → Suggests driver/GPU checks
- Provides specific verification commands (nvidia-smi, nvcc)
- Links to official PyTorch installation instructions

### 2. UI Enhancements (image_recognition.py)

**Startup Logging:**
- Automatically logs CUDA diagnostics when application starts
- Visible in console output
- Helps identify issues immediately

**Training Logging:**
- Logs CUDA diagnostics when training begins
- Displayed in training metrics window
- Shows device being used for training

**Check CUDA Button:**
- Added to Training tab in device selection section
- Opens comprehensive diagnostics dialog
- Shows all diagnostic information
- Provides context-sensitive troubleshooting
- Includes "Copy to Clipboard" button
- User-friendly interface with clear explanations

**Enhanced Warnings:**
- Force GPU mode shows detailed warnings when CUDA unavailable
- Different messages for CPU-only vs CUDA present but unavailable
- Warnings include actionable next steps
- Links to nvidia-smi and PyTorch documentation

**Status Bar:**
- Shows current active device (CPU/GPU)
- Updated when device preference changes

### 3. Robust Device Selection

**Device Selection Modes:**
- **Auto (recommended)**: Uses GPU if available, CPU otherwise, no warnings
- **Force GPU**: Tries GPU, falls back to CPU with detailed warning
- **Force CPU**: Always uses CPU, no warnings

**Implementation:**
- Always uses `torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')`
- Models moved to device with `.to(device)`
- Tensors moved to device with `.to(device)`
- Graceful fallback in all cases
- Settings persisted in config/settings.json

### 4. Comprehensive Testing (test_features.py)

**New Test Classes:**

**TestCudaDiagnostics (5 tests):**
- test_get_cuda_diagnostics: Verifies data structure
- test_log_cuda_diagnostics: Tests logging output
- test_cuda_not_available_warning: Checks warnings
- test_cpu_only_pytorch_detection: Mocks CPU-only PyTorch
- test_cuda_installed_but_unavailable: Mocks CUDA unavailable

**TestEnhancedDeviceSelection (3 tests):**
- test_force_gpu_with_detailed_warning: Tests warnings
- test_device_always_valid: Ensures valid device always returned
- test_warning_messages_user_friendly: Checks message quality

**Test Coverage:**
- All device preference modes
- CPU-only PyTorch scenarios
- CUDA present but unavailable scenarios
- Warning message generation
- Settings persistence
- Backwards compatibility

**Results:** 32/32 tests passing

### 5. User Documentation (README.md)

**Added CUDA/GPU Troubleshooting Section:**

**Issue 1: CPU-only PyTorch**
- Symptoms
- Diagnosis
- Solution with specific installation commands
- Links to PyTorch website

**Issue 2: CUDA installed but unavailable**
