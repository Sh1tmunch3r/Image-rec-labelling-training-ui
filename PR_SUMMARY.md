# PR Summary: CUDA Detection and Device Selection Enhancement

## 🎯 Overview

This PR implements comprehensive CUDA detection, diagnostics, and troubleshooting for the Image Labeling Studio Pro application, specifically addressing GPU detection issues on Windows systems with NVIDIA hardware.

## ✅ Problem Solved

Users with CUDA-capable systems (e.g., Windows with GTX 1650, CUDA 13.0, Driver 581.57) were unable to utilize their GPU for training because:
- No diagnostic tools to identify issues
- Unclear error messages
- No troubleshooting guidance
- Limited device selection feedback

## 🚀 Solution Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive CUDA Diagnostics

**At Application Startup:**
- Automatically logs PyTorch version, CUDA version, availability, device count, device name
- Shows CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable
- Provides context-sensitive troubleshooting steps
- Links to PyTorch installation instructions

**At Training Start:**
- Logs same diagnostics in training metrics window
- Shows exact device being used for training
- Helps debug training issues

### 2. "Check CUDA" Button (NEW)

**Location:** Training tab → Device selection section

**Features:**
- Comprehensive diagnostics dialog
- Shows all CUDA-related information
- Context-sensitive troubleshooting steps
- Copy-to-clipboard for bug reporting
- User-friendly interface

### 3. Enhanced Device Selection

**Three Modes:**
- **Auto (recommended)**: Uses GPU if available, CPU otherwise
- **Force GPU**: Tries GPU with detailed warning if unavailable
- **Force CPU**: Always uses CPU

**Features:**
- Detailed, actionable warning messages
- Different messages for CPU-only PyTorch vs CUDA unavailable
- Graceful fallback in all cases
- Settings persisted across sessions

### 4. Comprehensive Documentation

**README.md:**
- New CUDA/GPU troubleshooting section (~3000 words)
- Common issues and step-by-step solutions
- Verification commands (nvidia-smi, nvcc, PyTorch checks)
- Links to official installation instructions

**Technical Docs:**
- CUDA_DETECTION_FEATURES.md: Complete feature description
- TESTING_GUIDE.md: Testing scenarios and instructions
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md: Design overview and benefits

### 5. Robust Testing

**New Tests:** 8 tests in 2 new test classes
- TestCudaDiagnostics (5 tests)
- TestEnhancedDeviceSelection (3 tests)

**Coverage:**
- CPU-only PyTorch detection
- CUDA installed but unavailable
- Warning message generation
- Device selection modes
- Settings persistence

**Result:** 32/32 tests passing

## ✨ User Experience

### Scenario: User has GPU but CPU-only PyTorch

**Before this PR:**
- Application uses CPU without explanation
- User doesn't know why GPU isn't used
- No way to diagnose issue

**After this PR:**
1. Startup logs show "CUDA version: None"
2. Training tab shows "Detected: CPU"
3. User clicks "Check CUDA" button
4. Dialog explains "CPU-only PyTorch installation"
5. Provides link to pytorch.org with install command
6. User reinstalls PyTorch with CUDA → GPU detected

### Scenario: User has CUDA PyTorch but outdated drivers

**Before this PR:**
- Application uses CPU without explanation
- User confused why GPU not detected

**After this PR:**
1. Startup shows "CUDA version: 12.8, available: False"
2. Check CUDA suggests running nvidia-smi
3. User sees outdated driver version
4. Dialog provides link to NVIDIA driver download
5. User updates driver → GPU detected

### Scenario: Everything works correctly

**Before this PR:**
- Works but user not sure if GPU is being used
