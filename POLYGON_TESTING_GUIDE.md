# Polygon Annotation Testing Guide

This document provides step-by-step instructions for testing polygon annotation functionality.

## Prerequisites

- Image Labeling Studio Pro installed and running
- A project with images loaded

## Test Case 1: Create Polygon Annotations

### Steps:
1. Open or create a project
2. Load an image in the Labeling tab
3. Press `P` or click polygon mode button to enable polygon drawing
4. Click multiple points on the image to create a polygon (at least 3 points)
5. Right-click to finish the polygon
6. Select or enter a label for the annotation
7. Verify the polygon appears on the image with the label
8. Press `Ctrl+S` or click Save to save annotations

### Expected Results:
- âœ… Polygon is drawn with visible vertices
- âœ… Polygon is saved successfully
- âœ… Status shows "âœ“ Saved successfully"
- âœ… Annotation appears in the results panel

## Test Case 2: Verify Annotation Counting

### Steps:
1. Create polygon annotations on 2-3 images
2. Check the statistics panel (ðŸ“Š section)
3. Note the "Annotated Images" count
4. Navigate to Dashboard tab
5. Check "Annotated" card and "Total Annotations" card

### Expected Results:
- âœ… Annotated images count includes images with polygon annotations
- âœ… Total annotations includes polygon annotations
- âœ… Class distribution shows labels from polygon annotations

## Test Case 3: Dataset Validation

### Steps:
1. Create polygon annotations on several images
2. Navigate to Training tab
3. Click "âœ“ Validate Dataset" button
4. Review validation results

### Expected Results:
- âœ… Validation passes with polygon-only annotations
- âœ… No warnings about "Missing box data" for polygon annotations
- âœ… Status shows valid annotation count including polygons
- âœ… Classes detected include polygon annotation labels

## Test Case 4: Mixed Annotations (Boxes + Polygons)

### Steps:
1. Create box annotations on some images (press `B`, drag to draw box)
2. Create polygon annotations on other images (press `P`, click points, right-click)
3. Create both box AND polygon annotations on one image
4. Save all annotations
5. Check statistics and validate dataset

### Expected Results:
- âœ… Both box and polygon annotations are counted
- âœ… Statistics show correct total annotation count
- âœ… Validation passes for mixed annotations
- âœ… All annotations appear in results panel

## Test Case 5: COCO JSON Export

### Steps:
1. Navigate to Recognition tab (after creating some detections or use labeling annotations)
2. Save detected/labeled images
3. Choose COCO JSON format when saving
4. Locate the export folder (exports/recognition_TIMESTAMP/)
5. Open `annotations/instances.json` file
6. Search for polygon annotations

### Expected Results:
- âœ… Export completes successfully
- âœ… COCO JSON file exists
- âœ… Polygon annotations have `segmentation` field with coordinate list
- âœ… Polygon annotations have `bbox` field calculated from polygon
- âœ… `segmentation` is in format: [[x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,...]]
- âœ… Box annotations don't have `segmentation` field

### Sample COCO Structure for Polygon:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "image_id": 1,
  "category_id": 1,
  "segmentation": [[100.0, 100.0, 200.0, 100.0, 150.0, 200.0]],
  "bbox": [100, 100, 100, 100],
  "area": 10000,
  "iscrowd": 0
}
```

## Test Case 6: Per-Image JSON Export

### Steps:
1. Navigate to Recognition tab
2. Save detected images
3. Choose "Per-image JSON" format
4. Locate the export folder
5. Open an annotation JSON file for an image with polygon
6. Check the structure

### Expected Results:
- âœ… Export completes successfully
- âœ… JSON files created for each image
- âœ… Detections with polygons include `polygon` field
- âœ… `polygon` field contains array of [x,y] coordinates

### Sample Per-Image JSON:
```json
{
  "image": "image1.png",
  "width": 640,
  "height": 480,
  "detections": [
    {
      "label": "triangle",
      "polygon": [[100, 100], [200, 100], [150, 200]],
      "confidence": 0.95
    }
  ]
}
```

## Test Case 7: Training with Polygon Annotations

### Steps:
1. Create a project with polygon annotations only
2. Navigate to Training tab
3. Click "âœ“ Validate Dataset"
4. If dependencies are installed, try to start training
5. Monitor training logs

### Expected Results:
- âœ… Dataset validation passes
- âœ… Training starts without errors
- âœ… Images with polygon annotations are used for training
- âœ… Polygons are automatically converted to bounding boxes for training
- âœ… Training proceeds normally (if dependencies installed)

## Test Case 8: Undo/Redo with Polygons

### Steps:
1. Create a polygon annotation
2. Press `Ctrl+Z` to undo
3. Press `Ctrl+Y` to redo
4. Delete the polygon and undo

### Expected Results:
- âœ… Undo removes the polygon
- âœ… Redo restores the polygon
- âœ… Undo after delete restores the polygon

## Test Case 9: Navigation with Polygon Annotations

### Steps:
1. Create polygon annotations on image 1
2. Navigate to next image (Right arrow or Next button)
3. Create annotations on image 2
4. Navigate back to image 1 (Left arrow or Prev button)
5. Verify polygons are preserved

### Expected Results:
- âœ… Polygons are saved when navigating away (if auto-save enabled)
- âœ… Polygons are loaded when returning to image
- âœ… All polygon details (points, label) are preserved

## Test Case 10: Copy/Paste Annotations (if implemented)

### Steps:
1. Create a polygon annotation
2. Press `Ctrl+C` to copy
3. Navigate to another image
4. Press `Ctrl+V` to paste

### Expected Results:
- âœ… Polygon annotation is copied
- âœ… Pasted polygon appears on new image
- âœ… Label is preserved

## Regression Tests

Test that existing box annotation functionality still works:

### Box Annotation Tests:
1. âœ… Can create box annotations (press `B`, drag)
2. âœ… Box annotations are saved and loaded correctly
3. âœ… Box annotations appear in statistics
4. âœ… Box annotations are exported in COCO format (bbox field)
5. âœ… Box annotations are used for training
6. âœ… Can mix box and polygon annotations

## Common Issues to Watch For

1. **Polygon not finishing**: Make sure to right-click after placing points
2. **Validation warnings**: Should NOT see "Missing box data" for polygons
3. **Export missing polygons**: Check that `segmentation` field exists in COCO
4. **Training skips images**: Polygon images should be included in training
5. **Statistics not updating**: Polygon-annotated images should be counted

## Automated Tests

Run the test suite to verify:

```bash
# Test polygon export functionality
python test_polygon_export.py -v

# Test dataset validation with polygons (requires PIL)
python test_dataset_registration.py -v
```

## Notes

- Polygons require at least 3 points to be valid
- COCO format requires both `segmentation` and `bbox` for polygons
- Training with Faster R-CNN uses bounding boxes (polygons auto-converted)
- Polygon coordinates are stored in original image dimensions
- All polygon functionality is backward compatible with box annotations
