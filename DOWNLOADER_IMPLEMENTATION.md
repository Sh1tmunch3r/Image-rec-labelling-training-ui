# Image Downloader Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the new Image Download Harvester feature for the Image Labeling Studio Pro application.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Files Created

#### `ui/download_harvester.py`
- Full-featured image downloader UI using CustomTkinter
- **Key Features:**
  - Async downloads using `aiohttp` with concurrent throttling (max 5 simultaneous)
  - URL parsing from text input or file
  - Filename sanitization and collision avoidance
  - Sequential project naming (img_0001.png, img_0002.png, etc.)
  - Progress tracking with real-time updates
  - Detailed logging of successes and failures
  - Project integration with callback support
  - Modal dialog when launched from main app
  - Option to preserve original filenames when safe
  - Selenium support placeholder for dynamic pages

#### `ui/app_config.py`
- Application configuration persistence utility
- Stores user preferences in `config/app_config.json`
- **Persisted settings:**
  - Last selected project
  - Last selected model
  - Window geometry
  - Last download folder
- Simple API: `load_app_config()`, `save_app_config()`, `update_app_config()`, `get_app_config()`

#### `ui/tooltip.py`
- Simple tooltip implementation for CustomTkinter widgets
- Shows helpful hints on hover
- Dark-themed tooltips matching app style

#### `ui/__init__.py`
- Package initialization file

#### `test_download_feature.py`
- Comprehensive unit tests for downloader logic
- Tests filename sanitization, URL parsing, project naming, config persistence
- All tests passing ‚úì

### 2. Modified Files

#### `image_recognition.py`
- Added imports for new UI utilities
- Added app config loading in `__init__`
- Added `open_image_downloader()` method to launch the downloader
- Added `reload_image_list()` method to refresh images after download
- Modified `load_project()` to persist last project selection
- Updated `setup_menu_bar()` to add Tools ‚Üí Image Downloader menu item
- Added üåê Download button in Label tab navigation section
- Added tooltips to Export, Save, and Download buttons
- Modified button layout to fit Download button (reduced width from 130 to 85)

#### `requirements.txt`
- Added `aiohttp>=3.8.0` for async HTTP requests
- Added `selenium>=4.0.0` for dynamic page support (future enhancement)

#### `README.md`
- Added new section "üåê Image Download Harvester" in features list
- Updated "Load Images" section with Download option
- Added comprehensive "Image Downloader Usage" section with:
  - How to access the downloader
  - Step-by-step usage guide
  - Example URLs file format
  - Feature highlights

### 3. UI Integration

#### Access Points
1. **Menu Bar**: Tools ‚Üí Image Downloader
2. **Label Tab**: üåê Download button (between Load and Capture buttons)

#### User Experience Flow
1. User opens downloader from menu or button
2. If no project selected, user is prompted to select one
3. User pastes URLs or loads from file
4. User configures options (preserve names, use Selenium)
5. User clicks "Start Download"
6. Progress is shown in real-time with detailed logs
7. On completion, main UI image list is refreshed
8. Success notification is shown

#### Tooltips Added
- **Export button**: "Export annotations to various formats (COCO, YOLO, etc.)"
- **Save button (Label)**: "Save current image annotations to project (Ctrl+S)"
- **Save button (Recognize)**: "Export recognized images with annotations in selected format"
- **Download button**: "Download images from URLs directly to project"

## Technical Implementation

### Concurrent Downloads
- Uses `asyncio` with `aiohttp.ClientSession`
- Semaphore-based throttling (MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS = 5)
- Proper timeout handling (30 seconds per image)
- Exception handling for each download

### Filename Handling
- **Sanitization**: Removes unsafe characters, limits length
- **URL extraction**: Parses filename from URL path
- **Hash fallback**: Generates filename from URL hash if none available
- **Sequential naming**: Scans existing images and continues numbering
- **Collision avoidance**: Checks for existing files before writing

### Project Integration
- Downloads to `<project>/images/` folder
- Automatically creates images directory if needed
- Uses same naming convention as rest of app (img_XXXX.png)
- Callback mechanism to refresh UI after downloads

### Configuration Persistence
- JSON-based configuration in `config/app_config.json`
- Auto-saves last selected project when loading
- Enables smoother UX by remembering user preferences
- Extensible structure for future settings

## Testing

### Unit Tests
All core logic has been tested:
- ‚úì Filename sanitization from various URL formats
- ‚úì URL parsing with special characters and encoding
- ‚úì Sequential project numbering
- ‚úì Configuration save/load persistence
- ‚úì Error handling in edge cases

### Test Coverage
- `test_download_feature.py` includes:
  - Filename sanitization tests
  - URL parsing tests  
  - Project naming sequence tests
  - Configuration persistence tests

## Future Enhancements

### Planned (Not Yet Implemented)
1. **Selenium Integration**: For JavaScript-heavy pages that require browser rendering
2. **Batch URL Discovery**: Scrape image URLs from a webpage
3. **Image Validation**: Check image format and size before saving
4. **Resume Downloads**: Resume interrupted downloads
5. **Download Queue Management**: Pause, resume, and cancel individual downloads
6. **Duplicate Detection**: Skip already downloaded images
7. **Image Preview**: Show thumbnails before downloading

### Possible Extensions
- Integration with image search APIs (Google Images, Unsplash, etc.)
- Support for downloading from cloud storage (S3, Google Drive, etc.)
- Automatic image preprocessing (resize, crop, etc.)
- Download history and statistics

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users
- No breaking changes
- Existing projects and workflows continue to work
- New feature is opt-in via menu or button
- Configuration file is created on first use

### Dependencies
New dependencies required:
- `aiohttp>=3.8.0` - for async HTTP
- `selenium>=4.0.0` - for dynamic pages (optional)

Install with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Documentation

### User Documentation
- README.md updated with full usage guide
- In-app tooltips for key buttons
- Error messages provide clear guidance

### Developer Documentation
- Code is well-commented
- Docstrings on all public methods
- Type hints where applicable
- Clear separation of concerns (UI, logic, config)

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality
- ‚úì All Python files pass syntax checks
- ‚úì Consistent with existing code style
- ‚úì Follows project conventions
- ‚úì Proper error handling
- ‚úì No breaking changes

### User Experience
- ‚úì Clear visual feedback
- ‚úì Helpful tooltips

- ‚úì Seamless integration with existing UI

## Conclusion

The Image Download Harvester feature has been successfully implemented with:
- Robust async download capabilities
- Smart filename handling
- Full project integration
- User-friendly interface
- Comprehensive testing
- Complete documentation

All requirements from the problem statement have been met, with the exception of Selenium implementation which is prepared but not yet activated (checkbox present in UI, ready for future implementation).
