### Creating Your First Project
1. Click the **"New Project"** button in the top bar
2. Enter a descriptive name for your project (e.g., "cats_dogs_classifier")
3. Your project will be created with folders for images and annotations

### Adding Classes
Before annotating, you need to define the classes (labels) you'll use:
1. In the **Label** tab, find the "Classes" section
2. Click **"+ Add Class"**
3. Enter the class name (e.g., "cat", "dog", "person")
4. Repeat for all your classes

## Annotation Workflow

### Loading Images
You have two options for loading images:

5. Adjust as needed and save

### Editing Annotations
1. Click on an annotation in the list to highlight it
2. Press **Delete** or click **"Delete"** button to remove it
3. Use undo if you delete by mistake

### Batch Operations
**For multiple similar images:**
1. Annotate a reference image
2. Copy annotations (Ctrl+C)
3. Navigate through images
4. Paste (Ctrl+V) and adjust for each
5. Save each image (Ctrl+S)

## Training Models

### Preparing for Training
Before training, ensure:
- ‚úì You have at least 10-20 annotated images per class
- ‚úì All annotations are saved
- ‚úì Classes are properly defined

### Basic Training
1. Go to the **"Train"** tab
2. Select a preset:
   - **Fast**: Quick test (5 epochs)
   - **Balanced**: Good quality (10 epochs) - recommended
   - **Accurate**: Best results (20 epochs)
3. Click **"üöÄ Start Training"**
4. Monitor the progress bar and metrics

### Advanced Training Configuration
For experienced users, customize these parameters:

**Epochs**: Number of training cycles
- More epochs = better accuracy but slower
- Start with 10-20 for most cases

**Learning Rate**: How fast the model learns
- Default: 0.005
- Lower (0.001) for fine-tuning
- Higher (0.01) for faster initial learning

**Batch Size**: Images processed together
- Default: 2
- Increase if you have GPU memory
- Decrease if you get memory errors

**Momentum**: Optimization parameter
- Default: 0.9 (usually don't change)

**Weight Decay**: Regularization
- Default: 0.0005 (usually don't change)

**Data Augmentation**: Enables random transformations
- Recommended: Keep enabled
- Helps model generalize better

### Monitoring Training
Watch the metrics console for:
- Current epoch progress
- Loss values (lower is better)
- Time per epoch
- Final model save location

### Using Your Trained Model
1. Go to the **"Recognize"** tab
2. Select your project name from the dropdown
3. Capture or load an image
4. View recognition results with confidence scores
5. Save or copy results as needed

## Tips & Tricks

### Efficiency Tips
1. **Use keyboard shortcuts** - Much faster than mouse!
2. **Copy-paste similar annotations** - Save time on similar images
3. **Zoom in for precision** - Get accurate boundaries
4. **Batch similar images** - Process related images together

### Quality Tips
1. **Be consistent** - Annotate similar objects the same way
2. **Include edges** - Don't cut off parts of objects
3. **No overlap** - Avoid overlapping bounding boxes
4. **Check your work** - Review annotations before training

### Performance Tips
1. **Save frequently** - Don't lose your work!
2. **Use presets first** - Before manual tuning
3. **More data is better** - 50+ images per class is ideal
4. **Validate annotations** - Use Dashboard > Validate Annotations

## Dashboard Features

### Statistics
The dashboard shows real-time project metrics:
- **Total Images**: All images in your project
- **Annotated**: Images with saved annotations
- **Annotations**: Total annotation count
- **Classes**: Number of unique classes

### Class Distribution
See how balanced your dataset is:
- Visual bar chart
- Count per class
- Percentage distribution
- Identify under-represented classes

### Quick Actions

**Refresh Statistics**: Update all numbers

**Validate Annotations**: Check for issues
- Missing annotations
- Invalid JSON
- Corrupt files

**Export Report**: Generate text report
- Project summary
- Class distribution
- Statistics snapshot

**Backup Project**: Create a timestamped copy
- Saves all images and annotations
- Stored in projects folder
- Safety before major changes

## Import/Export

### Exporting Annotations
1. Click **"Export"** in the top bar
2. Choose format:
   - **COCO JSON**: Popular for research
   - **YOLO TXT**: For YOLO models
   - **Pascal VOC XML**: Classic format
   - **CSV**: For spreadsheet analysis
3. Select save location
4. Annotations exported!

### Importing Annotations
1. Click **"Import"** in the top bar
2. Choose source format
3. Select file to import
4. Annotations will be converted and loaded

## Troubleshooting

### "No project selected" error
- Create a new project or open an existing one first

### Can't see my annotations
- Make sure you clicked OK after labeling
- Check if you saved (Ctrl+S)
- Verify you're looking at the correct image

### Training fails
- Check you have at least 10+ annotated images
- Verify all annotations are saved
- Make sure classes.txt is not empty
- Try reducing batch size if memory error

### Image won't load
- Check file format (PNG, JPG, JPEG only)
- Verify file isn't corrupted
- Make sure file path doesn't have special characters

### Slow performance
- Close other applications
- Reduce zoom level
- Work with fewer images at once
- Consider smaller image resolutions

### Keyboard shortcuts not working
- Make sure the main window has focus
- Click on the canvas area
- Check if another app is capturing the keys

## Best Practices

### For Best Results
1. **Consistent Quality**
   - Same level of detail across all images
   - Similar box tightness
   - Consistent class naming

2. **Balanced Dataset**
   - Similar number of images per class
   - Variety of angles and conditions
   - Include edge cases

3. **Regular Backups**
   - Backup before major changes
   - Keep multiple versions
   - Export annotations regularly

4. **Documentation**
   - Note your class definitions
   - Document special cases
   - Keep training notes

### Workflow Recommendations

**Small Projects (< 100 images)**
1. Annotate all images first
2. Review and validate
3. Train with Balanced preset
4. Evaluate results

**Large Projects (> 100 images)**
1. Annotate in batches of 20-50
2. Train intermediate models
3. Test on new images
4. Refine and continue

**Production Models**
1. Start with Fast preset for testing
2. Use Balanced for development
3. Use Accurate for final model
4. Validate on held-out test set
